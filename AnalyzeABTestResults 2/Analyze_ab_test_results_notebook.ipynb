Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. For a user to \"convert\" means that they have decided to purchase the company's product.\n",

    "1) Regardless of the page they received, the probability for an individual to convert is **11.96%**.However, we accounted for Simpson's Paradox by analyzing the probability of both the treatment and control groups to convert. The probability for an individual in the treatment group to convert is **11.88%**, while the probability for an individual in the control group to convert is **12.04%**. These values lie around the previously calculated 11.96% probability for all individuals to convert, so we do not have to worry much about Simpson's Paradox. However, it is still good practice to analyze probabilities separately among the control and experimental groups.\n",

These values are very close, which proves that half of all unique users received the new page, while half of all other unique users received the old page. There are no duplicated user_ids, which means that each user received only 1 page throughout the whole experiment. This is a promising ratio because if half of all users received only 1 type of page, then our results will be more reliable as they are more *equally weighted*.\n",

    "\n",
    "1) The probability for an individual in the treatment and control groups to convert are 11.88% and 12.04%, respectively. Though this is not a substantial increase in conversion rate for the new page, this is a difference of 0.16% more for the new page. Even in comparison to the probability for an individual to convert regardless of the page they received, 11.96%, the treatment conversion rate is still higher at 12.04%, with a difference of .08%. Because the difference is so small, and without any statistical significance, we do not have sufficient evidence to make a conclusion.\n",

Therefore this z-score is consistent and agrees with the calculated values found in j and k.\n",

    "The results for coefficients in interaction between the UK and page on conversion rates (part h) are consistent with the coefficients in interaction between the UK and conversion rates alone (part g). This means that multicollinearity did not prove to be an issue between 'UK', 'ab_page', and 'UK_ab_page', as there is no visible dependency between the explanatory variables of country and type of page received. In addition, the exponentiated coefficients for 'UK_ab_page' and 'ab_page' are exactly the same in this logistic regression model, which helps to prove the statement that multicollinearity is not an issue with these variables.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "After examining our cleaned dataset through A/B testing and and a logistic regression approach, it can be safely concluded that **the website should switch to the new page.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Part I - Probability**, we explored and sanitized our dataset. This included finding incongruencies between the type of group (treatment or control) and what type of landing page they received (new or old). We dropped all instances where treatment did not match the new page and where control did not match the old page. We also accounted for conversion rates for all users regardless of the type of page they received, then counted conversion rates among users in the treatment and control groups separately. This was a safeguard in the case of Simpson's Paradox. We found that ***conversion rates among those in the control and experimental group are roughly similar at 11.88% and 12.04%, respectively.*** These results are reliable because the probability of receiving either the old or new page for any user is equally weighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Part II - A/B Testing**, we created a null and alternative hypothesis, implemented hypothesis testing through simulating under the null, and applied Z-Score testing. The null and alternative hypotheses focused on the difference in means of conversion rates for the old and new page, where it is summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_0 : p_{new} - p_{old} \\leq 0$$\n",
    "$$H_1 : p_{new} - p_{old} > 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After normalizing a sampling distribution under the null hypothesis, we found that the proportion of null values greater than our observed statistic (-3.177) was ***p = 0.9017***. Because this p-value is greater thant the threshold for Type I error rates at 0.05, we ***fail to reject the null hypothesis that conversion rates for users who received the new page are equal to or worse than the conversion rates for users who received the old page.***\n",
    "\n",
    "To receive similar results, we used Z-testing afterward using `stats.proportions_ztest`. The p-value calculated was 0.9050 and the Z-score was -1.3109. The p-value was similar to our previously-calculated p-value by an increase the thousandths place after the decimal. The negative value of the Z-score is consistent with the visualization of the normalized distribution under the null, as our observed statistic (-3.177e-07) lies to the left of the mean, 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "In **Part III - A Regression Approach**, we created yet another null and alternative hypothesis, then fit three logistic regression models. The null and alternative hypotheses for the logistic regression models were rearranged as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_0 : p_{new} = p_{old}$$\n",
    "$$H_1 : p_{new} \\neq p_{old}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After created dummy variables for the type of landing page a user received (1 for new page and 0 for old), we created a logistic regression model with 'converted' as the response variable with 'intercept' and 'ab_page' as the explanatory variables. After fitting this model, we received a p-value of **0.190** for users who received the new page. In comparison to the p-value calculated in Part II (0.9017), this p-value is cut by approximately half. \n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, we created a new DataFrame matching users with the country they were based in. Two regression models were created accounting for the country. The 1st model investigated the interaction between country and conversion rates alone. The 2nd model investigated the interaction between country & type of page received as explanatory variables, with conversion still being the response variable. The baseline variables were users based in the US and users who received the old page. The exponentiated coefficients between 'UK' and 'UK_ab_page' (users based in the UK & users based in the UK **and** received the new page) are the same at 0.9766. This suggests that there is no dependency between the explanatory variables 'UK', 'UK_ab_page', and 'ab_page', and thus multicollinearity should not be a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrapping It Up\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for these differences in p-values between the first regression model in Part III (**0.190**) and the hypothesis test in Part II (**0.9017**) is due to the difference in the types of testing. Part II's null and alternative hypothesis makes use of a one-tailed test while those in Part III's regression model makes use a two-tailed testing. This is due to the structure of both models' null and alternative hypotheses, where one calls for the proportion of extremes at the right-end tail, while the other calls for the proportion of extremes on both ends respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Significance**\n",
    "\n",
    "The threshold for Type I errors is at 0.05. Under all cases (hypothesis testing, Z-score, and logistic regression models), we never received a p-value less than the threshold. Therefore, ***we can safely conclude that we cannot determine if the new page increases the likelihood of conversion. Thus the website should conduct the A/B test for a longer period of time to see if a greater sample size would increase the variability of the response.***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Significance**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part I, the conversion rates among those in the control and treatment groups were at 11.88% and 12.04% respectively. Even if we decided to ignore statistical significance, the difference in conversion rates among the groups--0.16%--is too small to implement the new page design. In addition, using the time and resources to add the new page design may likely outweight this marginal benefit of an approximately +% conversion rate, ***so we can safely conclude that due to the barely marginal benefit of new conversion rates compared to the costs needed to deploy the new design, it is also not practically significant to switch to the new page design.***\n",
